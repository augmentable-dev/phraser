## phraser

Open source phrase management microservice for your applications. A centralized phrase database (key-value store) for your APIs, frontends, or anything else.

Hardcoding text (error messages, help text, feature explanations, etc.) into your source code is quick and dirty, but can be inefficient to maintain and especially difficult for non-developers (i.e. marketing) to modify.
